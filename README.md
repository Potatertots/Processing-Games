# Processing-Games
Various games built with Processing (Java). Includes Frogger, Pong, Whac-a-mole, and other classics.
An overall guide to each game follows (more detailed descriptions are available in the `description.md` file in each folder):

## Games

### Frogger
Probably the most fleshed-out game in this repository. Essentially the classic arcade game, Frogger.
Features character selection and high score functionality. Different characters give different boosts, check it out!

### Etch-a-Sketch
The classic childhood game, revamped. Includes a galaxy pen and also a Nyan-cat rainbow mode, complete with music. 

### Pong
Another arcade classic, featuring multiplayer mode as well. 
Difficulty and number of balls scales with level. Simple graphics make it a cathartic throwback to simpler times, before I had to do co-op applications :)

### Paint
More or less the same as the eponymous Microsoft program. Includes multiple brush colours, randomized palettes, and tracing functions if you're up for some dinky, digital adult coloring.

### Piano
It's a piano! It plays multiple notes.

### Whac-a-mole
Whack Rudyard Kipling, don't whack Gingy. 

### Terrain
Perlin noise generated terrain. Makes for a pretty background if you fiddle with the colours. An earlier, buggy version made it look straight out of the Take On Me music video.

Hope you enjoy!
